# Time complexity project

## Objective

This project is aiming to test your knowledge on time complexity by enhancing the time of the given code.  

## Problem  
Enhance the time complexity of the given code.   


## Implementation    
   
- The below function **calculates the sum of squares** by using a `for` loop.
- The time complexity is O(n) and the required time complexity is O(1).   

Hint:   
- We can calculate the sum of squares using a mathematical formula `n(n+1)(2n+1)/6`.     
```java
// Change the below code
    public static int sumOfSquares(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            result += i * i;
        }
        return result;
    }

```
